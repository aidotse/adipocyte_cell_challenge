# Documentation

Here we provide extensive documentation to facilitate the understanding of the problem, its context and the evaluation criteria that will be used to rank the hackathon contributions. 

## Dataset Description  
Description of data set from the call


## Problem Formulation 
This is the problem formulation document from the hackathon call 

## Evaluation Criteria Hackathon
Description of all evaluation criteria and how they will be combined to rank the hackathon contributions

## Report template 

This is a template for the project report to be handed in at the
hackathon dead-line. The purpose of this document is to enable the end-user to understand the solution
and to run the code for evaluation. The report is also a document which allows the end-user to reproduce the result of the solution from scratch.
Furthermore, the quality and coverage of the project report are themselves part of the evaluation criteria
for the hackathon contribution. This template thus serves the purpose of aligning the reports from the
different hackathon participants, allowing a fair report comparison.
